 # About me
 
 Hello, my name is Jamile Sousa, I'm 19 and I'm a Computer Engineer student at Instituto Federal do Ceará, Brazil.
 
 I have a cousin called Heloísa and she is 1 year and 8 months old. I love her so much and it was from her that the idea for my playground came up.
 I think she should learn some cool and ideal thins for her life in this times, that we all need to stay at home. Seeing that she already knows how to recognize parts of the human body and loves to fit games.
 So I decided to develop this playground so that she and other children from 1 to 2 years old can learn more about some healthy foods and games ideal for their ages from a young age.
