 - Note:
In this playground we will take care of a child to understand his creation in practice.
 
 A child who eats well grows up healthy. When the child has an adequate diet, his social development and development at school tend to be very good due to the role that nutrients play in brain skills.
 In addition, the ease and strength that children will have when performing activities that require bodily effort is much greater.
